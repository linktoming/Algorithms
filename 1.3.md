Initialize a counter to the size of count of all integer pairs.  
Each time do the find operation:
- if the find result is non of existing set contains the current integer pair  
      do nothing
- if the find result is one of the existing sets contains the current integer pair  
      decrease the counter by 1
- if the find result is one of the exiting sets contains one integer of current integer pair  
      decrease the counter by 1
- if the find result is two of the existing sets contains each one of the integer in the pair  
      decrease the counter by 2
