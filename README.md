Learning Notes on Algorithms
================

It's a good practice to [write the book you want to read.](http://austinkleon.com/2008/12/18/a-manifesto-write-the-book-you-want-to-read/)
and that's why I'm writing this one as an ongoing learning notes on Algorithms.

## Common Data Structures
1. Array (1 dimension, 2 dimension)
2. Linked List (Singly-lined doubly-linked, circular)
3. String related
4. Hashtable
5. Binary Tree (recursive and non-recursive Traversal,level wise)
6. BST
7. Prefix tree, suffix tree
8. Bit map
9. Simple graph (Graph questions are rare)
10. Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, Recursion, Sorting & Lookup

## Classic Topics on Alorithms
1. Sorting and Searching
2. Graph
