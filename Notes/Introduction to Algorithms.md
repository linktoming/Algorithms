### Algorithms and Data Structures
**Algorithms**: methods for solving problems that are suitable for computer implementation.  
The term _algorithm_ is used in computer science to describe a problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program. Algorithms are the stuff of computer science: They are central objects of study in many, if not most, area of the field.

**Data Structures**: methods of organising data involved in computation.  
Most algorithms of interest involve methods of organising data involved in the computation. Objects created in this way are called _data structures_, and they also are central objects of study in computer science.

Algorithms and data structures go hand in hand. In [_Algorithms in C_](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Parts-1-4-Fundamentals-Structures/dp/0201314525), the data structures are considered the byproducts or end products of the algorithms.

### Algorithm Design
**Algorithm design** is to devise problem-solving methods that use time or space as efficiently as possible.  
The primary reason for us to learn _algorithms design_ is that this discipline gives us the potential to reap huge savings, even to the point of making it possible to do tasks that would otherwise be impossible.

When a huge or complex computer program is to be developed, a great deal of effort must go into the understanding and defining the problem to be solved, managing its complexity, and decomposing it into smaller subtasks that can be implemented easily.

A general approach (in [_Algorithms in C_](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Parts-1-4-Fundamentals-Structures/dp/0201314525)) to developing algorithms is we start with a simple solution, then seek to understand that solution's performance characteristics, which help us to see how to improve the algorithm. After a few iterations of this process, we come to an efficient and useful algorithm for solving the problems.

### Analysis of Algorithms
The choice of the best algorithm for a particular task can be a complicated process, perhaps involving sophisticated mathematics analysis. This branch of computer science that comprises the study of such questions is called _analysis of algorithms_
