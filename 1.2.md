We first draw the graph representation of the connectivity, then it'll be easier to write out all the possible ways to connect two differrent objects.

![connectivity graph](https://raw.github.com/linktoming/notes-algorithms/master/connectivity.jpg)

Based on the graph, the solution is:  
3-4, 3-2-9-4, 3-2-0-8-4
4-9, 4-3-2-9, 4-8-0-2-9
8-0, 8-4-3-2-0, 8-4-9-2-0
2-3, 2-9-4-3, 2-0-8-4-3
5-6
2-9, 2-3-4-9, 2-0-8-4-9
5-9
7-3
4-8, 4-3-2-0-8, 4-9-2-0-8
0-2, 0-8-4-3-2, 0-8-4-9-2
6-1
